# Lightning

Meet Lightning. 

> A bot framework for [Revolt](https://revolt.chat). 

This framework lets you, as a developer, focus on the things that matter, such as your user's feedback, and not handle the messy stuff; let Lightning handle that for you.

To keep updated with the package and it's development, join the [Support Server](#support).

## From Scratch
If you want to start from scratch, here's an example on how you could start:

```typescript
    import { LTNClient, Strictness } from 'lightning'
    import path from 'path'

    const client = new LTNClient({
        commandsDir: path.join(__dirname, 'commands')
        eventsDir: path.join(__dirname, 'events')
        config: {
            structureType: 'OBJECT' // OBJECT | CLASS | DECORATOR
            typescript: true
            strictness: Strictness.MODERATE   
        }
    })

    client.start('your token')
```
