# Lightning

Meet Lightning. 

> A bot framework for [Revolt](https://revolt.chat). 

It lets you as a developer focus on the things that matter, such as your user's feedback, and not handle the messy stuff; let Lightning handle that for you.

To keep updated with the package and it's development, join the [Support Server](#support).
